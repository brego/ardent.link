### The protagonist

<img src="/images/avatar.jpg" alt="Image of Brego's face" class="avatar">

Hi! Ny name's [Kamil Brego Dzieli≈Ñski][p1], and I'm a nice guy who likes solving
problems, usually with programming, design or planning.

I live in Copenhagen, Denmark, where I work as a developer at [Hiper][p2]. I
mostly work with front-end, but I'm increasingly coming back to my back-end
roots.

I've started building websites when I was 15 years old, and it kind of stuck
since then. A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, I was one of the founding
members of the [CakePHP][p3] project.

You can always get in touch with me at [kontakt@kamil.nu][p4].

### The setting

I've wanted to have a blog since forever. Being a dumb perfectionist however,
I've probably built 30-something versions of this general concept. The
differentiating factor with this edition, I hope, is that I've just went ahead
and built this thing over a weekend, and slapped it on a server.

Ont the techical side, the source code of this site can be read on [GitHub][s1],
but it's basically built on top of [Gulp][s2], [Markdown][s3] and [Sass][s4], with
a bunch of  other stuff thrown in for good measure. The "engine", such as it is,
is mostly a modified [gulp-mvb][s5] -- see my modest changes at [GitHub][s1].
